# CLI Calculator

Basic C project to learn how to create a calculator in the CLI that can execute basic mathematical formula.

Things to do:
- Lex
- Parse
- AST

Then give the data to a mathematics kernel that can solve whatever the input was.

I would like to be able to solve it symbolically and 'normal'. 

This is mainly for me to learn C.
